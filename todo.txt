Tabs
- Fix the tab bar background color to be the same as visual studio code when multiple tabs are open.
  currently it appears to be the same as the status line.

Cursor
- Use bg light for the cursor line from the vim theme and bglighter for the selected cursor line as it looks better and like VSCode.

Noice
- Fix the noice pop up menu to look nice.
- Fix the noice notifications from LSP in bottom right as they are hard to read.

VSCode
- Try and get them highlight groups matching VSCode as much as possible.
- VSCode changes the background color of words that match the current word under the cursor, whereas nvim changes to foreground color
  which is not as nice. Try and get this to match VSCode.
